This plot shows the total fare by city type per week. 

## 3. Summary
Urban cities have an enormous number of riders and drivers. At the same time, urban cities have the lowest average fare per ride. Rural cities show the lowest number of riders and drivers but have the highest average fare per driver. 

Pyper should focus on putting more marketing dollars on Urban and Suburban areas to increase the total number of rides since this two are the least profitable areas.
